#Introduction

Recently, there have been a lot of discussions about the effects of social network and video games on sleeping hours. We wanted to make some research about that subject and thus we gather some data about some factors that may help us understands the influence of video games and social network and the differences between genders. We also want to see the difference between the social netwok called facebook well know for everyone and the other social networks like snapchat , instagram , whatsapp , twitter and at least viber.

First we can see  a significant difference between girls and boys 's interrest about video game. Boys seem to be more attracted than girls .By contrast social networks like facebook or the others are as popular for girls than for boys and no difference are relevant.




 ### Between age group

We can easily see that video game time's and other social network time's (like snapchat instagram ,...) distribution are hardly affected by the age class. Indeed young population seem to be more attracted to video game and other social network time . In comparison facebook seem to be nearly the same distribution for the two age classes facebook seem to be popular not only about young poeple but also about all the other.












#Discussion and evaluation

First of all ,we found that facebook interest is really more widespread into the population than video games and other social networks are for old poeple these last are more populare for the young population

Secondly , we found that the sex is not a relevant factor to separate social network utilisation but in spite of that we also found that boys played more at video games than girls.
