```{r importation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sleep <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15bi2eKujJLabLjSyodTHFJKFzx1dk-GtS9fnImSb1-Y/export?format=csv", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
```

```{r}
sleep$sex <- as.factor(sleep$sex)


```


```{r global view , eval=FALSE}
skimr::skim(sleep)
```



##Charts and analysis
