#Introduction
Recently, there have been a lot of discussions about the effects of social network and video games on sleeping hours. We wanted to make some research about that subject and thus we gather some data about some factors that may help us understands the influence of video games and social network and the differences between genders

#Goal
Our goal is to determine if there is a relation between the hours passed on the social media (and the video games) about the sleeping hours.



#Material and methods
This project and the analysis have been realised with Rstudio. The data has been harverst randomly and anonymously.

#Results

##Data table

```{r setup}
SciViews::R
```




```{r importation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sleep <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15bi2eKujJLabLjSyodTHFJKFzx1dk-GtS9fnImSb1-Y/export?format=csv", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
```

```{r}
sleep$sex <- as.factor(sleep$sex)


```


```{r global view , eval=FALSE}
skimr::skim(sleep)
```



##Charts and analysis

###

```{r}
chart(sleep, ~ facebook_and_messenger_time %col=% age) + geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE)
```
